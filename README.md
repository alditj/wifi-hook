# wifi-hook
This Python program functions as a Wi-Fi password stealer. It exploits a feature of the Windows operating system to extract passwords from stored Wi-Fi profiles, then writes the data to a text file. The program is designed to run in the background without a console window and can be compiled into a single .exe file.
